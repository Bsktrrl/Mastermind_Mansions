## Project Description
I wanted to recreate my favorite mini-game from the board game "Mansions of Madness": the Mastermind mini-game, so I could play it as often as I wanted without searching through a scenario in the app.
<br>
<br>
When I was starting to learn "Unity Enigine", I wanted to see if I was able to create games that have been comercalised.
This mini-game build upon the rules of the classical "Mastermind" where you make your guesses based on the feedback from the program.<br>
If you have guessed correct symbol in the correct spot, you get a "start".<br>
A correct symbol, but in the wrong spot, gives you a "Magnefying glass"<br>
A wrong guess leaves an empty space.<br>



One of my favorite features in the Board Game "Mansions of Madness" is its take on the game "Mastermind".
Unfortunately, it is not guarantied to stumble upon it during the game, so I wanted to see if I could make a gaming experiance similar to what's displayed in the Screen-portion of the game.
<br>Made with C# for "Unity Engine".
