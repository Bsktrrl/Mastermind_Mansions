## Project Description
I wanted to recreate my favorite mini-game from the board game "Mansions of Madness": the Mastermind mini-game, so I could play it as often as I wanted without searching through a scenario in the app.
<br>
<br>
When I was starting to learn "Unity Enigine", I wanted to see if I was able to create games that have been comercalised.
This mini-game build upon the rules of the classical "Mastermind" where you make your guesses based on the feedback from the program.<br>
- If you have guessed correct symbol in the correct spot, you get a "start".<br>
- A correct symbol, but in the wrong spot, gives you a "Magnefying glass"<br>
- A wrong guess leaves an empty space.<br>
<br>
<br>
For this version, you spawn in new levels at random, swapping between symbols and numbers, and the array of slots to guess, as possibilities from "Mansions of Madness". You may spress the "Reset" button to change the level.
You may press the "Reset" button to change the level.
